  INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES
  RECORD - A record is each entry that exists in the table. It corresponds to the row of a table.
  FIELD - It is a column in a table which contains specific information about every record in the table
  STORED TABULAR DATA - When data is organized in rows and columns.
  RELATIONAL DB - A few related tables form a relational database.
  ENTITY - The smallest unit that contain meaningful set of data. Hence ROWS represent HORIZONTAL ENTITY. COLUMNS represent VERTICAL ENTITY.
  DATABASE OBJECT - Table can be referred as entity/ DB object.
  
  SQL is DECLARATIVE(non-procedural) programming. It mainly concentrates on what to fetch instead of 'HOW'. 
  It has an optimizer which separates your task into smaller steps.
